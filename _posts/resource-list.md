I am quite persnickety about my setup and tried dozens of themes and icons before eventually settling on the Stranger Things theme (5,000 downloads). I watched the first few seasons of the Netflix series and it was decent, but I absolutely love the aesthetics of this theme. For a change of pace, I will use Github Themes (12mm downloads and stick to the dark themes unless you want to burn your eyes out).

As far as icons go, they are typically less important to the overall look of your code editor, but I still like changing them up. It is probably silly, but I prefer to change the icons as it is a bit of fresh air considering how much time I spend looking at them. I go back and forth between the ones with the most downloads, which are:  vscode-icons (17mm downloads)  Material Icons (22mm downloads).
There is one really cool retro theme that I wanted to point out called Visual Studio classic icons (23k downloads). For those old folks out there, it will remind you of coming home from school and sending IM bombs on AOL. Yes, it was called that before AIM. And yes, AIM is just iMessage.

Please share your thoughts on my off the beaten path suggestions and any other themes or icons you love or hate...
