Lately, I've noticed a bit of a slowdown in my blog posts, and I want to share why. I embarked on a journey to set up my portfolio website, diving deep into the world of web development. This adventure introduced me to the wonders of tailwindcss and next.js, tools that were a bit out of my comfort zone but immensely rewarding to learn. It was a back-and-forth process that took about ten days, filled with moments of both excitement and challenge.

As I wrap up this project, my next goal is to complete my Solidity projects and feature them on my site. I'm eager to share the final result with you all, and I plan to deploy it using Vercel soon.

This experience taught me several valuable lessons:

Embracing projects slightly beyond my current skills was a powerful way to learn and grow.

A well-crafted portfolio website can truly differentiate you in a job market saturated with traditional resumes.

The advancements in AI are so profound that they can simplify even complex development tasks, making certain libraries feel almost redundant.
Interestingly, the initial 10% of the website's development consumed half of the time, but once over that hurdle, the momentum carried the remaining 90% at the same pace.

For those new to web development, diving into next.js can significantly clean up and enhance your code, especially with features like routing, server-side rendering, and new tags like Head, Link, and Image.

When working with AI tools, remember they tend to default to generating React code, so keeping your AI prompts set to consistently mention implementing next.js and their specific tags and tailwindcss can help steer the AI in the right direction.

Despite the occasional frustrations of coding, the tools and resources available today, especially with AI, make it an exciting time to learn and enter the field.

This journey has been a testament to the power of stepping out of your comfort zone and the endless possibilities that technology and a willingness to learn can unlock. 

I look forward to sharing more of my journey and the projects I've been working on with you.
